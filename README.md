# SeleniumIDETests 

It is a remake of my project called SeleniumPyTest by Selenium IDE.

For the tests in the addtoCartAndDelete and problemUser files to work properly, there must be no product in the shopping cart.

Since some features are not available in Selenium IDE, minor changes were made in 2 tests, but the results are the same.
